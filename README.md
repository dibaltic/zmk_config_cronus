This is the firmware for [cronus keyboard](https://github.com/dibaltic/cronus). 

## Getting Started
If you'd like to make your own firmware.
[Here are the instructions to get started.](https://github.com/dibaltic/zmk_cronus/blob/main/getting_started.md)

Alternatively, to use my keymap as it is you can download the firmware from the [latest action run](https://github.com/dibaltic/zmk_cronus/actions), and then refer to the [ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#installing-the-firmware) to flash the firmware to your keyboard.

## Keymap Reference
It is based on the [bird layout](https://github.com/jcmkk3/bird-layout)
