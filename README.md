This is the firmware for [cronus](https://github.com/dibaltic/cronus). It is based on the [bird layout](https://github.com/jcmkk3/bird-layout), but of course you can make it whatever you'd like. 

If you'd like to make your own firmware.
[Here are the steps you need to take.]

Alternatively you can download the firmware from the [latest action run](https://github.com/dibaltic/zmk_cronus/actions) and then refer to the [ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup#installing-the-firmware) to flash the firmware to your keyboard.

If you'd like to use [nickcoutsos keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) I've found the hummingbird layout to work with this keyboard in the editor.
